# Image Similarity Search with Deep Learning

A web application that allows users to:
- Upload an image to find visually similar images
- Manage unwanted images with a trash system
- View and navigate through results in an intuitive interface

## Key Features
- **üîç Deep Learning-based Search** - Uses ResNet-50 to extract image features and find similar images  
- **üóëÔ∏è Smart Trash Management** - Mark unwanted images and batch delete them  
- **üñºÔ∏è Interactive Gallery** - View enlarged images with keyboard navigation (‚Üê ‚Üí arrows)  
- **‚ö° FastAPI Backend** - Efficient Python backend for image processing  
- **üñ•Ô∏è Modern UI** - Clean interface with drag-and-drop functionality  

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, ResNet-50
- **Feature Storage**: HDF5
